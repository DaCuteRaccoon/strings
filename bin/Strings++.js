(function(){
undef = undefined
// Type undef == undefined in the console, and you get true. How neat is that? You don't have to type all of undefined.

NULL = null
nil = null
Nil = null
NIL = null
none = null
None = null
NONE = null

True = true
TRUE = true
False = false
FALSE = false

return void 0
})()


// If you are wondering why this is in a function, it's because if it werent, the console would say the last value in the list. For example, if the last line was NULL = null, it would say null in the console. With the function I can make it say what I want.

// tl;dr
