## Strings++
### What it is:
Strings++ is an addon that I made, for JavaScript. It simply lets you use values for other values. For example, you could do `string(0);`, which would return `'0'`. Notice how `string` is lowercase. But without Strings++, doing <em>(this is just an example)</em> `string('Hey, is that ' + 'a string?')` would return `Uncaught RefrenceError: string is not defined at <anonymous>:1:1`.

Basically, it makes your life easier (if you are a coder, that is).
